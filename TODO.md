# TODO

<!-- TODO: -->
This is my wishlist for nvim:
- [x] being able to launch xdg-open
- [x] try-out oil -> Love it
- [ ] split the config (DOING)
- [ ] Have some sort async support for make and compilers (See if needed)
- [ ] Investigate snippets
- [ ] Use vim-test
- [ ] Create powerfull text objects with Tree-sitter (maybe not needed)
- [ ] Improve Git support
